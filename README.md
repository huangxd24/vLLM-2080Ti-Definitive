# ⚡ vLLM 2080 Ti Definitive Edition

![vLLM 2080 Ti Definitive Edition cover](docs/assets/vllm-2080ti-cover.jpg)

The definitive vLLM runtime for dual RTX 2080 Ti / SM75 serving.

This is a hardware-focused fork that preserves the patched source, launch
profiles, and runtime notes needed to reproduce the working 2080 Ti vLLM stack.

Fork release: `v0.1.5`
Base vLLM: `0.21.0`

Headline evidence: Qwen3.6 27B reaches `100+ tok/s` single-request decode, and
Gemma4 31B reaches `~100 tok/s` single-request decode on the same dual 2080 Ti
TP=2 runtime.

## 💡 Why RTX 2080 Ti for LLM Inference?

In August 2018, NVIDIA launched the RTX 2080 Ti and moved the enthusiast GPU
line from GTX into the RTX era. Years later, the card is still remembered as a
landmark Turing design. With 22GB memory mods, NVLink, high memory bandwidth,
and enough raw compute to remain relevant, dual 2080 Ti cards turn out to be a
surprisingly strong local AI inference platform.

| Metric | 2x 2080 Ti 22GB + NVLink | 3090 Ti 24GB baseline | Ratio |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Physical CUDA core count | 8,704 | 5,376 | 1.62x |
| SM count | 136 | 84 | 1.62x |
| Physical Tensor Core count | 1,088 | 336 | 3.24x |
| Dense Tensor FP16 matrix throughput | 228 TFLOPS | 160 TFLOPS | 1.43x |
| Total physical memory bandwidth | 1,232 GB/s | 1,008 GB/s | 1.22x |
| Total VRAM capacity | 44GB | 24GB | 1.83x |
| Secondary-market price anchor | about $550 with NVLink | about $1,100 | about 0.5x |

The project is built around a simple cost/performance bet: use roughly half the
secondary-market price of an RTX 3090 Ti to get a dual 22GB RTX 2080 Ti setup
that can match or exceed it on the physical resources that matter for LLM
serving, then use vLLM runtime work to turn those resources into real tokens.

That is the first value of this fork: take old but strong Turing silicon and
make it behave like a serious 27B/31B-class inference platform through Marlin,
FlashQLA/FlashInfer/FA2, TurboQuant/INT8 KV, MTP, and CUDAGraph integration.

## 🧩 Core Routes

Serving shape:

- This project optimizes for extreme single-concurrency performance on dual
  2080 Ti: one personal-agent style workload, one serious 27B/31B model, and
  the largest practical context window this hardware can sustain.
- It is not a multi-tenant serving stack. Multi-agent use is supported best as
  queued workspace isolation, not as parallel long-prefill throughput. Long
  prefill work is capacity-safe when tuned, but it is effectively serialized by
  the runtime scheduler on this TP=2 profile.

Status: 🟢 full support; 🟡 partial support; 🔴 performance regression; ⚪ not
supported.

### Qwen3.6 27B Mature Route

Qwen-family 27B is the primary production route for this fork. It has the most
complete coverage across FP8/INT4 Marlin weights, native MTP, FP16/INT8 KV,
native 256K context, YaRN capacity profiles, and image-serving compatibility.
Fast path: Qwen uses FlashQLA-SM70-SM75 for Gated DeltaNet / linear-attention
prefill, FlashInfer / FA2 for full-attention prefill, head_dim=256 fast-path
controls, and native MTP with CUDAGraph for decode.

| Feature | FP16 KV | INT8 KV | TurboQuant KV |
|---|---|---|---|
| Marlin weight route | 🟢 FP8/INT4 | 🟢 FP8/INT4 | 🟢 FP8/INT4 |
| Native MTP3 decoding | 🟢 supported | 🟢 fast mode | 🟡 experimental |
| Native 256K context | 🟢 text route | 🟢 text route | 🟡 not a preset |
| YaRN 512K extension | ⚪ not the target route | 🟢 supported capacity route | ⚪ not a preset |
| No-eager / CUDAGraph | 🟢 supported | 🟢 supported | 🟢 graph-safety fixed |
| Fast prefill path | 🟢 FlashInfer / FA2 | 🟢 FlashInfer / INT8 path | 🟡 route-specific |
| Multimodal image serving | 🟢 FP8/INT4 routes | 🟡 INT4 route only | 🔴 not promoted |
| Current preset status | 🟢 recommended | 🟢 recommended | 🟡 experimental only |

Mode note: FP16 KV is the safe service path. INT8 KV is the recommended fast
capacity/performance path. TurboQuant KV is kept for selected experiments, not
as the default YaRN preset. Exact profile names, measured throughput, and
capacity evidence are maintained in [Profile Guide](profiles/README.md).

### Gemma4 31B Experimental Route

Gemma4 31B is kept as a secondary experimental route. Current validated
profiles are much less mature than Qwen: native MTP is not supported by this
runtime, FP16/default KV can run 64K noMTP, and compressed-KV 256K routes are not
promoted.

| Feature | FP16 KV | INT8 KV | TurboQuant KV |
|---|---|---|---|
| Marlin weight route | 🟢 GPTQ target | 🟢 GPTQ target | 🟢 GPTQ target |
| Native MTP decoding | ⚪ unsupported | ⚪ unsupported | ⚪ unsupported |
| Native 256K context | ⚪ not validated | 🔴 not supported | 🔴 not supported |
| YaRN 512K extension | ⚪ not supported | ⚪ not supported | ⚪ not supported |
| No-eager / CUDAGraph | 🟢 noMTP route | 🔴 init/fallback issues | 🔴 admission limited |
| Fast prefill path | 🟡 slow 64K route | 🔴 not promoted | 🔴 not promoted |
| Multimodal image serving | ⚪ not promoted | ⚪ not supported | ⚪ not supported |
| Current preset status | 🟡 experimental only | 🔴 not promoted | 🔴 not promoted |

## 🧪 Tested Model Checkpoints

This section records checkpoint-level validation. It is intentionally stricter
than "vLLM can load it": a supported checkpoint can start and generate, while a
recommended checkpoint also has a useful throughput/context tradeoff on dual 2080 Ti.

FP8 is the recommended high-quality Qwen 8-bit route; INT4 remains the default
performance/capacity route. AutoRound INT8 is experimental.

## 🛠️ Target Hardware & Runtime

- Validated GPU profile: dual RTX 2080 Ti 22GB, SM75, NVLink, tensor parallel
  size 2
- CUDA/PyTorch: CUDA 12.8, `torch 2.11.0+cu128`
- Fork release: `v0.1.5`
- Base vLLM: `0.21.0`
- Repository identity: `vllm-2080ti-definitive`
- Runtime identity: `vllm-sm75-tp2-cu128`
- Compatibility target: NVIDIA Turing / SM75 GPUs. Other Turing cards still
  need profile validation for VRAM capacity, P2P/NVLink behavior, model
  head_dim, KV dtype, and CUDAGraph/MTP settings.

## 🚀 How To Use

For a source checkout:

```bash
./build.sh
./launcher.sh
```

Then choose three things in the launcher:

1. Checkpoint directory
2. Profile path, starting from [profiles/README.md](profiles/README.md)
3. Port and local/LAN access

A successful launch prints an OpenAI-compatible API URL. For scripted use:

```bash
MODEL_DIR=/path/to/qwen-or-gemma-checkpoint \
PROFILE=qwopus36-27b/safe/int4/fp16kv-256K-mtp3-text-only.env \
MODE=safe \
PORT=8000 \
SERVICE_SCOPE=lan \
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 \
./launcher.sh --non-interactive
```

Profiles declare compatible modes, not a recommended launch mode. Set
`MODE=safe`, `MODE=normal`, or `MODE=fast` explicitly when you want a specific
mode; the launcher validates that choice against the profile.

## 🧭 Profiles

Start from [Profile Guide](profiles/README.md). Profiles are organized as
`profiles/<model>/<mode>/<weight>/<route>.env`, for example
`qwopus36-27b/safe/fp8/fp16kv-128K-mtp3-text-only.env` and
`qwopus36-27b/fast/int4/int8kv-256K-mtp3-text-only.env`.

KV precision is positioned as: FP16/default KV for quality, INT8 KV for the
balanced route, and TQ4NC for compression. TQK8V4 is not a formal route right
now because it has not shown a practical capacity or throughput advantage over INT8
KV in the validated profiles.

Mode names are intentionally simple:

- `safe`: production default. It favors output stability and allows
  FP16/default KV with MTP; quantized KV must use noMTP.
- `normal`: middle mode for diagnostics and manual checks.
- `fast`: high-performance mode. Use it for quantized KV with MTP; it has
  higher memory and quality risk.

Experimental profiles live under each model directory, such as
`profiles/qwopus36-27b/experimental/fp8/`. The launcher hides experimental routes
by default unless you point Profile directory at that subdirectory or set
`PROFILE_INCLUDE_EXPERIMENTAL=1`.

## 🚀 MTP And KV Precision

Use the bundled profiles instead of hand-tuning MTP and KV settings first.
MTP is already set to the best practical value for each route. Choose KV by
intent first: FP16/default KV for maximum output quality, INT8 KV for the best
quality/capacity balance, and TQ4NC when compression is the priority.

Detailed benchmark notes are kept in
[MTP Task Sensitivity](docs/mtp-task-sensitivity.md) and
[Qwen3.6 KV Throughput Sweep](docs/qwen36-kv-throughput-sweep.md).

## ❓ Hardware Q&A

**Q: What GPU interconnect is required?**

A: NVLink is recommended, but PCIe P2P is the real baseline requirement. The
validated system uses NVLink and an intentionally non-ideal PCIe topology, with
one card at PCIe 3.0 x1 and the other at PCIe 3.0 x4. With NVLink carrying
GPU-to-GPU traffic, PCIe slot bandwidth is not the main bottleneck. Without
NVLink, do not treat narrow PCIe links as proven sufficient; confirm P2P
behavior and benchmark the actual topology.

**Q: Does the host need a strong CPU or a lot of RAM?**

A: No. The validated path has run on a low-end desktop CPU with 16GB RAM. More
CPU/RAM mainly helps compile cache generation, downloads, and local build work,
not steady-state token generation.

**Q: Which Turing GPUs make sense? Can I mix 11GB and 22GB cards?**

A: The fully validated target is dual RTX 2080 Ti 22GB. Other good candidates
are high-VRAM TU102-class cards: TITAN RTX 24GB, Quadro RTX 6000 24GB, and
Quadro RTX 8000 48GB, preferably in pairs with NVLink or confirmed PCIe P2P.
Mixed 11GB + 22GB RTX 2080 Ti setups are not recommended for these 27B/31B
profiles because vLLM TP=2 is effectively constrained by the smaller rank.
Smaller Turing cards can run smaller models, but they are not the main target
for this stack.

**Q: Which CUDA, PyTorch, and driver versions are validated?**

A: The validated runtime is CUDA 12.8 + `torch 2.11.0+cu128`. Use a recent
NVIDIA driver that supports your host GPUs and is compatible with the CUDA
runtime. Do not mix build/runtime assumptions casually: keep the PyTorch CUDA
lane, local CUDA toolkit, FlashInfer/FlashQLA builds, and launch profile
aligned.

**Q: What other hardware risks matter?**

A: Cooling, power stability, and enough SSD space for model files and compile
caches. Thermal throttling can hide as a software regression, especially during
long prefill or repeated CUDAGraph/AOT compilation runs.
